SLUG PARK
talking points

- what it does right now
	- input from users about entering and leaving the parking lot
	
- for the future
	- using geotag data from users
	- using YOLO: Real-time object detection -> installing webcam using machine learning to detect cars on 2D still images
		or 2D videos (http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)

INNOVATION
Judging Criteria
Novelty: Is the approach or solution novel? Does it substantially depart from similar products? 
	- solution is novel for UCSC campus
	- but based off of solutions for other parking structures
	
Technical Merit: How elegant is the solution? Was a particularly difficult design challenge met? How polished is the Hack? How complete is the Hack, as presented? What work was actually accomplished as opposed to what was envisioned?
	- python
	- what is special about the code?
	
Impact/Use Potential: How much does an individual benefit from this hack? How many people will benefit from the hack?
	- everyone on campus can benefit from this /everyone who commutes
	- can affect one's decision to take the car to campus -> could even have environmental effects
	- daily use of the app / website before driving to campus
	
Design: 
	- website with easily understandable meters / gauges to indicate the status of the parking lot
	- easy to use
	- could be turned into an app too
	- but website is simple enough to be mobile friendly
	- usage is definitely self-apparent
